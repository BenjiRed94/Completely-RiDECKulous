            <p>Surrak is probably one of, if not, my favourite commander in all of <em>Magic</em>. He's pretty badass, after all, he is depicted on not <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386652" target="blank">one</a>, but <em> <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442159" target="blank">two</a> cards</em> where he's straight punching something much bigger than him in the face, and <em>winning!</em></p><br />
            <p>As the general of an EDH deck, he's pretty decent at the forefront of a creature-based deck, and thats the kind of deck I like to play. As a minor backstory, I've been playing <em>Magic</em>, and specifically, EDH on and off for about 6 years. I've always enjoyed the idea of playing big, explosive spells, or sending armies of massive creatures at my opponents to win the game. That's what drew me into <em>Magic</em>.</p>
            <p>I briefly played some standard around the Return to Ravnica/Theros block time when I first started, but I didn't really get into it until Khans of Tarkir. That was my first pre-release, and while watching spoiler season (shoutout to Wedge of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/themanasource" target="blank">TheManaSource</a>) Temur just resonated with me for some reason - and that was the clan I chose during each pre-release (well, Atarka during DTK).</p><br>

                <img src="../source_images/Temur Ascendancy.jpg" alt="Temur Ascendancy" />
                <p>The Temur clan had the mechanic 'Ferocious'</p>
            </div><hr>
            <h3>Ok, backstory over</h3>
            <p>Temur is probably my favourite colour combination for <em>Magic</em>, and EDH in particular, taking two of the best colours, and adding in a great support colour just feels sublime - it's hard to argue with that. First, let's see what each colour offers</p><br>
            <p><strong>Green</strong> - firstly, my favourite color, providing access to ramp, probably the single most important aspect of Timmy/Tammy EDH - because you can't cast <a class="open-modal">Tooth and Nail</a> if you dont have the required 9 mana (well, there is plenty of ways to, but hardcasting is way cooler), as well as coming with some of the most efficently costed beaters available in all of <em>Magic</em>. It's almost over-obsession with nature means it's probably the single best color for dealing with noncreature threats - especially artifacts and enchantments. Green doesn't, however, have much in the way of direct creature removal, though fight effects can usually fill that role well enough. As for card draw, what green has can be very powerful, but it relies very heavily on creatures to be good.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Blue</strong> - While not my favourite color, giving you access to the 3 most important words in <em>Magic</em>: <strong>DRAW A CARD</strong> is pretty damn strong, and again is another fundamental aspect of building any EDH deck. Counterspells are most excellent as well, nothing quite like telling your friend "No." - in fact, being the main colour that can interact with the stack is pretty damn powerful - there's a damn good reason that it's one of the most popular colours in eternal formats. What blue lacks, unfortunately, is ways to deal with anything that's hit the board already - the only real way to deal with it is to bounce it and then counter it when it gets recast. Bouncing things can be extremely powerful though, just look at <a class="open-modal">Cyclonic Rift</a>.</p>
            <div class="quote-image clearfix">
                <img src="../source_images/Temur Charm.jpg" alt="Temur Charm" />
                <p>It focused on creatures with power 4 or greater</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Red</strong> is likely my second favourite color, despite being one of the less useful in the colour pie, with little-to-no access to ramp outside artifacts, and much poorer card draw in the form of <em>'impulse draw'</em> effects - still, it typically tends to beat white in these aspects, so that's something. Thankfully it provides us with some seriously powerful cretures -  I'm a particular fan of those  with the 'Dragon' type, nothing screams red like a giant winged lizard spewing fire across the countryside (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHF_bIjIPAE" target="blank">Trogdor forever!!</a>). Another of reds upsides is its direct damage dealing capabilities, through cards like the classic <a class="open-modal">Lightning Bolt</a> and EDH all star <a class="open-modal">Warstorm Surge</a>, it's hard to find anything quite like reds firey desire to burn all the things. These cards have great usability and flexability in EDH, especially in a creature heavy deck when talking about Surge.</p><hr>
            <h3>The choice is simple</h3>
            <p>So, these colours each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and like any colour combination in <em>Magic</em>, they help to balance each other out. Temur is my personal choice because it gives me access to two of my favourite colours, and adds in arguably the most powerful colour in <em>Magic</em>, so it feels like the right choice.</p><br>
            <p>Surrak suits perfectly as the commander of choice because he embodies what I want to do in commander - play big dumb creatures, set off powerful effects, and stop my opponents from stopping me. He's a fantastic commander, and I honestly don't know why he isn't talked about and used more (though, at time of writing, he is at ~1200 decks on <a href="https://edhrec.com/" target="blank">EDHREC</a>). The deck I'm wanting to build is looking to win via combat, but along our journey we'll look into the combos available to us in these colours, and how they might work in the deck.</p><br>
            <p>For now though, I hope you've enjoyed reading, this isn't something I've ever done before, so I'm excited to get it out into the world. Until next time dear reader - may your pulls be sweet and your topdecks true.</p><br>
