            <h3>brewing with surrak - general redundancy</h3>
            <img src="../source_images/Rhythm of the Wild.jpg" alt="rhythm of the wild">
            <h6>published - 28/03/2019</h6>
            <p>Cards that can replicate the same or similar effects as your chosen general, either as an almost perfect copy, or as adding similar enough effects to give you redundancy and keep the deck working in the desired way, are invaluable - this is how combo decks work, especially good ones in EDH, because they use tutors to add a second, third and fourth copy of one of, or each of their combo pieces.</p><br />
            <p>For Surrak, there are a few different effects that we want to and need to add to our deck - so let's break Surrak down as best we can:</p><br>
            <section class="card-rules">
                <p>
                    Flash<br>
                    Surrak Dragonclaw can't be countered<br>
                    Creature spells you control can't be countered<br>
                    Other creatures you contol have trample
                </P>
            </section><br>
            <p>As we've discussed, Surrak is pretty good, granting our creatures a way to push damage through in greens typical form of evasion, as well as letting us cast our creatures unimpeded by making them uncounterable - so lets work from this at the bottom up 'casue Surrak has quite a few layers.</p><br>
            <div class="quote-image clearfix">
                <img src="../source_images/Nylea God of the Hunt.jpg" alt="nylea god of the hunt">
                <p>Nylea is a pretty beefy gal, and she gives our stuff much needed trample</p>
            </div><hr>
            <h3>deploy the giant, implacable death lizard</h3>
            <section class="card-rules">
                <p>Other creatures you control have trample</p>
            </section><br>
            <p><strong>Trample</strong> is likely the easiest of Surrak's abilities to replicate, it's an evergreen mechanic, and there have been a lot of other creatures and effects that have been printed that give your other creatures trample - one of the more reccent examples that comes to mind is <a class="open-modal">Nylea God of the Hunt</a>. Nylea is a pretty complex card herself, but we're looking specifically at the <em>'Other creatures you control have trample'</em> line of text, that's the bit that we want to replicate. Her bonuses, mainly being an indestructible 6/6 beater that can pump other creatures AND dodge creature exile if your devotion is low enough, are just icing on the pain cake.</p><br>
            <p><a class="open-modal">Archetype of Aggression</a> is another from the same block, and is part of a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+[archetype]+[of]" target="blank">cycle</a> which we'll come to another time, that has another useful line of text tacked onto it - <em>'Creatures you opponents control lose trample and can't have or gain trample'</em> which is a great effect, because it not only benefits our creatures, but it denys our opponents' creatures from that same ability. It's an OK sized body at 3/2, not great but better than nothing.</p><br>
            <p>Other examples that we have include <a class="open-modal">Brawn</a>, one that's very popular, but not one of my favourites outside mono green; <a class="open-modal">Khenra Charioteer</a> and <a class="open-modal">Aggressive Mammoth</a> are both from recent sets and have trample and give other creatures trample - but they don't do much else to make them stand out, though the Mammoth does have a pretty beefy body; Noncreature options include Primal Rage and Gruul War Plow, the latter of which being able to turn itself into a 4/4 Juggernaut, but neither really fit what we want to do here.</p><br><hr>
            <h3>Gaea sings with the voice of nature rampant</h3>
            <section class="card-rules">
                <p>
                    Surrak Dragonclaw can't be countered.<br>
                    Creature spells you control can't be countered. 
                </p>
            </section><br>
            <p><strong>Can't be countered</strong> is a much more difficult to replicate effect, especially on a large scale because while we are in the colours that get the phrase most frequently, it typically appears on a single spell basis, rather than a bonus provided across the board - nevertheless, we do have some options. First of which is <a class="open-modal">Prowling Serpopard</a>, a Cat Snake (which is good enough to include it alone) from the Amonkhet block that replicates this exact effect perfectly, as well as providing us with a 4/3 body to boot, which isn't nothing to be sure.</p><br>
            <div class="quote-image clearfix">
                <img src="../source_images/Alchemist Refuge.jpg" alt="alchemist's refuge">
                <p>Flashing in spells is pretty amazing, especially for only UG</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong><a class="open-modal">Rhythm of the Wild</a></strong> is a brand new card from Ravnica Allegiance that stops our creature spells from being countered, which would be useful enough itself for 3 mana, but giving our nontoken creatures Riot is extremely useful, 'cause it allows our creatures to swing the turn we drop them with haste, or should we have another haste enabler we can give them a +1/+1 counter on arrival, which we'll be more than happy to have.</p><br><hr>
            <h3>I can call an army to my side in the blink of an eye</h3>
            <section class="card-rules">
                <p>
                    Flash
                </p>
            </section><br>
            <p><strong>Flash</strong> is probably the one mechanic of Surrak that we dont necessarily need to replicate, though if we can find space in the deck to do it then all the better. On that note, <a class="open-modal">Alchemist Refuge</a> and <a class="open-modal">Winding Canyons</a> would likely be the ones I'd include becasue lands are typically a lot harder to remove than artifacts, enchantments and creatures - Canyons limits us to creature spells only, but that's typically what we want to be casting, so it's not a massive negative.</p>
            <p><strong><a class="open-modal">Vedalken Orrery</a></strong> and <strong><a class="open-modal">Leyline of Anticipation</a></strong> are both permanent flash effects for all of our spells and they're both super powerful to have in any deck, because it lets you play in a very reactive and defensive style - saving your mana and spells until the very last second, letting you advance your gameplan nearly unimpeded. The main problem with them, and Canyons is included in this too, is that they're very, very expensive, each at <strong>over Â£20</strong> at the time of writing.</p><br><hr>
            <h3>Picking and choosing</h3>
            <p>Having these redundant effects in the deck will help to make our plan of samshing in with big beaters much more consistent - I want to now decide on what ones to include in the final deck, after all, we only get 1 spot, and we need to make each spot count as best we can. That's why my picks for the final product are;</p><br>
            <ul class="in-the-99">
                <li><a class="open-modal">Nylea God of the Hunt</a> - She does everything I want and more, I can't say no to that.</li>
                <li><a class="open-modal">Archetype of Aggression</a> - Denying something to my opponents is always good, even if they don't care until its too late.</li>
                <li><a class="open-modal">Prowling Serpopard</a> - I want to have the Cat Snake in my deck, saving me from coutnerspells is just good.</li>
                <li><a class="open-modal">Rhythm of the Wild</a> - I'll get to more effects like it later, but Haste is <em>extremely</em> useful in a creature heavy deck.</li>
                <li><a class="open-modal">Alchemist Refuge</a> - It's the budget option here and that's why I'm choosing it, that doesn't mean it's bad though.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Each of these cards does something Surrak does that we want to replicate and all but Serpopard give us additional value by bringing something else to the table, which I'm pretty happy about. That's it for now though kind reader, I hope you've enjoyed this installment, and until next time - may your pulls be sweet and your topdecks true.</p>
